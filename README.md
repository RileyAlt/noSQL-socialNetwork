### Description

My Motivation for the project was to understand back end servers while utulizing Express.js API and configuring using Sqeuelize to get to our MySQL database

The project was built to create a responsive local server host that can manage an Ecommerce structure. You are able grab objects by different ids, by many or by a single product/catergory

This solved how to us Object-Relational Mapping to navigate in our databases and how we can have everything connected to flow very easily 

What I learn from the project was how to use API routing and Mapping when using Express.js and Sequlize to manage the databases
